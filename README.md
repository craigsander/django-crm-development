# django-crm-development
An open CRM project for non-profits using Django. 

The goal of this project is to serve as a collaboration point for developers hoping to develop a Django-based CRM system for non-profits.

Initial development will simply be a discussion of potential features, mvp requirements, and a definition of core models and functionality.

We'll be starting at the Wiki and discussing. If you have some interest in this project, check it out and comment!
